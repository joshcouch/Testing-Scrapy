This project must be run using the project_env environment:

Run 'project_env\Scripts\activate.ps1' in powershell  ('deactivate' to exit virtual env)


packages installed = [scrapy, scrapy-playwright]

then run 'playwright install'

Can use a requirements.txt file to show what is required to recreate this virtual environment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOPm01BVrk for more info) 

Don't save files in the project_env folder
